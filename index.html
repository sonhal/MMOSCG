            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>The Syrian conflict is disrupting the education of millions of children, in addition to threatening their 
                physical safety and psychosocial wellbeing. According to the 2015 Save the Children report, “The Cost of 
                War. Calculating the impact of the collapse of Syria’s education system on Syria’s future”, approximately 
                2.8 million Syrian children are not receiving any form of education inside Syria and across the region. 
                Literacy rates were at 95% for 15-24 year-olds prior to the start of the conflict, but Syria now has one of 
                the lowest school enrolment rates in the world.</p>

              <h2>How we can help</h2>
                <p>Achieving reading and writing fluency (literacy) is foundational for lifelong learning, and therefore a 
                    particularly important skill for all children to acquire. Being literate in the language one uses at home 
                    also makes it easier to learn second languages and hence facilitates the integration into host-country 
                    education systems.</p>
                    <p>
                    However, Syrian children both inside and outside of school are living under the extreme stress of a 
                    protracted conflict. Elevated and prolonged stress levels can impede brain development and cause 
                    learning challenges, memory problems and emotional regulation difficulties. Given that psychosocial 
                    wellbeing is so fundamental for the ability to learn, many of the ongoing non-formal educational 
                    programmes targeting children from areas affected by humanitarian crises and protracted conflict 
                    include fun, play and stress relief approaches as an integral part of their overall learning efforts.
                    The rationale behind this multi-phased competition is that the high level of smartphone ownership 
                    among Syrians makes a digital approach a scalable option for reaching as many out-of-school children as 
                    possible with a learning supplement that can potentially help build their literacy skills and enhance their 
                    psychosocial wellbeing.</p>
                    <p>
                    The project seeks to supplement existing formal and non-formal education programmes and clinical 
                    psychosocial support interventions for Syrian children with an engaging smartphone application (game) 
                    which is primarily intended for household use.</p>

                <p>
                    The project is aiming to implement the solution using native application technologies. 
                    This is to ensure a good and robust user experience for the end user. A second benefit 
                    is the full access native applications provide to phone resources.</p>

                  cloud providers that will grant access to a wide array of endnodes for the application data. Our users
